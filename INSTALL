To build PIPS-SBB on Sierra:

1. Clone PIPS into the PIPS subdirectory via:

git clone git@git.mcs.anl.gov:PIPS.git PIPS

2. Build PIPS-SBB using the following command:

rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build && \
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../LLNL-Sierra.cmake .. && make

This compound command does 5 things:

a) removes any existing build directory

b) creates a build directory for an out-of-source build,
   which is standard practice for CMake

c) changes the current working directory to the build
   directory

d) calls CMake with a toolchain file that includes
   settings appropriate for Sierra; CMake outputs a makefile

e) calls Make to execute the makefile, which builds PIPS-SBB
   All executables will be in this "build" subdirectory,
   which at this point in the instructions, should be the
   current working directory.

3. If you are developing PIPS-SBB, sometimes, you may have
   to regenerate the Makefile in response to source code changes.
   Change your directory to the root directory of the PIPS-SBB
   repository, then repeat step 2 to regenerate this Makefile and
   rebuild PIPS-SBB.
